    "provenance": "Possibly with William O. Oldman, London [see note 1]. Possibly with Ralph Nash, London [see note 2]. With Merton Simpson, New York, by 1977; sold to Denyse Ginzberg and Marc Ginzberg, New York, 1977; sold through Lance Entwistle, London to private collection, New York, June 15, 1992; sold through Schweizer Premodern, New York, to the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Conn., 2022 \r\n\r\nNote 1: According to information provided by Denyse Ginzberg to Schweizer Premodern (email from Denyse Ginzberg to Victoire de Viguelas, October 12, 2022, copy in curatorial file). William Ockleford Oldman (1879 \u2013 1949) was a British collector and dealer of ethnographic art, and European arms and armor. Known for his M\u0101ori and Polynesian collections, hundreds of works of African art also passed through his hands. His business W.O. Oldman, Ethnographical Specimens, London was active between the late 1890s and 1914. Oldman purchased items from various sources including from auctions, directly from other collectors and dealers and also from many small British museums and historic houses. Oldman sold many Zulu works of art over the years. According to his recently digitized sale records 77 objects attributed to the Zulu peoples passed through his Gallery between 1902 and 1903; a further 126 between 1904 and 1910; and 96 between 1910\u20131914. In 1912, Oldman sold the Penn University Museum 72 Zulu objects including an axe related to this example (AF3522).

(Email from Denyse Ginzberg to Victoire de Viguelas, Schweizer Premodern, October 12, 2022, copy in curatorial file). Ralph Nash (1928\u20132014) was a dealer whose Gallery \u2018The Art of Man\u2019 was active from the late 1960s until 1980, when Nash moved to Cannes, France. A number of significant South African works of art including Nguni staffs are known to have passed through his gallery (see, for example, Sale, William Brill Collection, Sotheby\u2019s, New York, November, 17 2006, lot 126 and Sale, Hubert Goldet Collection, Ricqles, Paris, June 30, 2001, lot 334).
