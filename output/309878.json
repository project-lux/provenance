In April 1933, following Hitler\u2019s rise to power, and as a German-Jew, Goldschmidt fled Nazi Germany via Switzerland and London, ultimately settling in New York. Although he managed to transport some of his collection with him, many of the objects, including his collection of Renaissance works of art, were left behind at his mansion on Mattha\u0308ikirchstrasse. In July 1933, Goldschmidt was further coerced into selling his mansion to the Italian Fascist regime to serve as their German embassy. His art collection was subsequently displaced and moved to his private office in Berlin. The Renaissance collection remained there until June 1936 when it was consigned to Hugo Helbing. Three-hundred lots were offered for sale and of the successful bids, the proceeds of the sale never reached Goldschmidt.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Dr. Lemmers-Danforth was a pediatrician and notable art collector. In 1963, she donated around five-hundred works of art to the city of Wetzlar, including Virgin and Child with Angels and Cherubim. In 1967, the collection was put on display at the Palais Papuis, Wetzlar. In 2020, following extensive provenance research on the collection, and with the recognition that the 1936 sale had been forced and the direct result of Nazi persecution, the Virgin and Child with Angels and Cherubim was restituted to the heirs of Jacob Goldschmidt. \r\n\r\n",
