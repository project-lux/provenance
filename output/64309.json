Julius Priester (1870\u20131954), Vienna [see note 1]; confiscated by the German National Socialist Government (Nazi party), May 11, 1939 [see note 2]. Recovered at Depot Salzbergbau, Alt-Aussee, Austria, by March 7, 1946 [see note 3]; transferred by the Federal Monuments Office (BDA) to Max F\u00f6hr (died 1947), Vienna, June 24, 1947 [see note 4]; restituted to Julius Priester (1870\u20131954), Mexico City, by July 25, 1947 [see also note 4]; by inheritance to his wife, Camilla Priester (n\u00e9e Robitschek, 1885\u20131962), Mexico City, 1954; by inheritance to Camilla Priester\u2019s sister-in-law, Lilly Priester (n\u00e9e Matathias), Mexico City, 1962 [see note 5]; by inheritance to her daughter, Anny Salton (died 1997), New York, by 1970 [see notes 5 & 6]; sale, Sotheby Parke-Bernet, New York, February 12, 1970, lot 63; sold to Bond Street Galleries, London, February 12, 1970 [see note 6].

Beginning in the early 1920s, he assembled a notable art collection, which he displayed in his apartment and office in Vienna. As a Jew, his collection was lost due to Nazi persecution following the German annexation (Anschluss) of Austria in March 1938. Julius and his wife, Camilla Priester (n\u00e9e Robitschek), fled to Paris in March 1938. In August 1940 they reached Mexico, settling permanently in Mexico City. For additional information on the history of the Priester Collection, see: Lillie, Sophie. \"Was Einmal War.\" Vienna: Czerin Verlag, 2004, pp. 904-909\r\n\r\nNote 2: The painting is listed as \u201cvan Byeran\u201d in a 1938 inventory of the Priester collection compiled by the German National Socialist government (see: Lillie, Was Einmal War, 2004, p.906)\r\n\r\nNote 3: \u201cSeized Art Collection of Julius Priester, State Monuments Office, Vienna, March 7, 1946,\u201d BDA-Archive, Vienna, Restitution Materials, K 43; PM Priester Julius, GZ.1543/1946 (copy in accession file). The Salzbergbau Altaussee are salt mines in Austria, which were used by the German National Socialist government as storage facilities for confiscated art.\r\n\r\nNote 4: \u201cAcknowledgment of Receipt, Salzbergbau, Alt Aussee, Austria, June 28, 1947,\u201d BDA-Archive, Restitution Materials, K 43; PM Priester Julius, GZ. 3582/1947 (copy in accession file). Following the painting\u2019s transfer to Julius Priester\u2019s representative in Austria, Max F\u00f6hr, the painting was cleared for export by the BDA on July 25, 1947 and almost certainly transferred directly to Julius Priester in Mexico City (Email from the BDA-Archive, Vienna, to the Gallery, August 1, 2023, copy in accession file)\r\n\r\nNote 5: In a letter from Salton to Dr. Podlesnigg, director of the BDA, she requests any papers or documentation about the recovery and ownership history of the van Beyeren and other works of art from the Priester collection. She notes that she inherited the works of art from her mother, Lilly Priester, and that \u201cmy mother inherited a house in Mexico and all its contents including the art objects discussed in the letter from her sister-in-law, Mrs. Camilla Priester, who in turn had been the universal heir of Mr. Julius Priester.\u201d (\u201cLetter from Anny Salton, New York, to Dr. Podlesnigg, Federal Monuments Office (BDA), Vienna, September 30, 1969,\u201d BDA-Archive, Restitution Materials, K 43; PM Priester Julius, GZ. 7375/1969, copy in accession file; see also: \u201cLetter from Anny Salton, New York, to Professor Robert Eigenberger, Vienna, November 19, 1968,\u201d BDA-Archive, Restitution Materials, K 43; PM Priester Julius, GZ. 8267/1968. copy in accession file)\r\n\r\nNote 6: Sotheby\u2019s sale records, \u201cRose\u2019s Cards\u201d (copy in accession file)\r\n\r\nNote 7: Kunsthandel de Boer bought a half-share of the painting from the Brian Koetser Gallery in November 1972. The full name of the buyer, \u201cWalter,\u201d possibly \u201cWolter,\u201d cannot be made out from the inscription on the Kunsthandel de Boer stock-card (Kunsthandel de Boer stock-cards, Kunsthandel de Boer, Amsterdam, copy in accession file)\r\n\r\n",
