    "provenance": "Austrian Imperial Collections, Belvedere Palace, Vienna, by 1884 (inv. no. 1229); transferred to the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, 1891 (inv. no. GG 648) (on loan to the Reichskanzlei, Berlin, from 1938) [see note 1] (transferred to an air-raid shelter, by August 31, 1944) [see note 2]. Sale, \"The Property of a Gentleman,\" Christie\u2019s, London, December 13, 1991, lot 1; sold to Thomas Agnew\u2019s, London, December 13, 1991 (stock no. B1869); sold to Monika Schaefer (ne\u00e9 Winter, died 2019) and Dr. Herbert Schaefer (1910\u20132011), Malaga, Spain, December 18, 1991 (on loan to the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Conn., 1993\u20132019); bequeathed to the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Conn., 2019 (deaccessioned July 2021); repatriated to the Republic of Austria, July 2021; transferred to the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, July 2021 (inv. no. GG 648)\r\n\r\nNote 1: The Reichskanzlei (Reich Chancellory) was the office of the Chancellor of Germany; the painting was displayed with others on loan from the Kunsthistorisches Museum in the entrance hall for the offices of the Reichsminister, Dr. Hans Lammers (1879\u20131962) (German Federal Archives, Koblenz, B323/466; National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, Maryland, Ardelia Hall Collection, Restitution Claim Records, NARA M1947, Record Group 260, Roll 0042)\r\n\r\nNote 2: The paintings on loan from the Kunsthistorisches Museum were transferred to an air-raid shelter in the basement of the Reichskanzlei around August 1944. A letter from August 31, 1944, from the Reich Chancellor Willy Meerwald (1868\u20131960) to the directorship of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, discusses the movement of the works of art noting that the transfer had been ordered by Adolf Hitler (1889\u20131945) and that the paintings were to remain there until the end of the war. (Angela Sch\u00f6nberger, Die neue Reichskanzlei von Albert Speer: zum Zusammenhang von nationalsozialistischer Ideologie und Architektur, Gebr. Mann Verlag: Berlin, 1981, p.142, note 72)\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe fate of the painting following its transfer to the air-raid shelter is unknown. The Reichskanzlei was heavily damaged during the Battle of Berlin (April\u2013May 1945), one of the last major Allied offensives during the Second World War. What remained of the building was part of the Soviet Zone of occupation, and it was destroyed shortly thereafter. Pursuant to research that uncovered the painting\u2019s ownership history, the Gallery contacted the Kunsthistorisches Museum in August 2020 to alert officials there that the painting was in the Gallery\u2019s collection. Museum officials confirmed that the painting had never been recovered and they were seeking its return. In April 2021, the Gallery\u2019s Governing Board Collection Committee voted to deaccession the painting for transfer to Austria. For a more comprehensive summary on the painting\u2019s provenance and return to Austria, see: Antonia V. Bartoli, \"The Repatriation of a Painting to Austria,\" Yale University Art Gallery Bulletin (2022\u201323), pp.24\u201331\r\n",
