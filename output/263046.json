    "provenance": "The artist; probably given to Katherine Sophie Dreier (1877\u20131952), New York, early 1920s; probably given to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme, New York; probably given to the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Conn., or the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library (Yale University), New Haven, Conn., 1941; reportedly removed from Yale University by Pontus Hult\u00e9n (1924\u20132006), Stockholm, 1960; given to Ulf Linde (1929\u20132013), Stockholm, then Danderyd Municipality, Sweden, early 1960s; by inheritance to his wife, Nina \u00d6hman-Linde (born 1944), Liding\u00f6, Sweden, 2013; transferred to the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Conn., 2018\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the Gallery was contacted by Nina \u00d6hman-Linde about \u201cSketch for Rotary Glass Plates.\u201d The drawing had been given as a birthday present to her husband, Ulf Linde, an art critic and Duchamp scholar, by Pontus Hult\u00e9n, former director of the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, and founding director of the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. On a visit to Yale in the summer of 1960 while examining \u201cRotary Glass Plates\u201d (YUAG acc. no. 1941.446a-c) for potential inclusion within an exhibition, Hult\u00e9n reportedly removed the sketch, along with three others, from the artwork\u2019s storage box.\r\n\r\nThe Gallery is grateful to Nina \u00d6hman-Linde for the object\u2019s transfer and to Duchamp scholar Paul B. Franklin for providing additional context surrounding the object\u2019s ownership history.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Marcel Duchamp, Katherine S. Dreier and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Collection gift to the Gallery, see: The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme \u2013 Modernism for America, ed.
