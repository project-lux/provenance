Shein, Providence, R.I., agent for the Frederick Douglass Institute of Negro Arts, Washington D.C., January 9, 1978, Currier Museum Archive, Manchester, N.H., copy in accession file. The Frederick Douglass Institute of Negro Arts (also called the Frederick Douglass Museum of African Art) joined the Smithsonian Institution in August 1979 and changed its name to the National Museum of African Art in 1981. Although other paintings by Duncanson were in the former Douglass Institute collection and transferred to the National Museum of African Art, research conducted by the Gallery and Smithsonian in March-April 2024 has been unable to confirm the date and method of transfer of this painting from the collection.\r\n\r\nNote 3: Email from Phil Alexandre, Alexandre Gallery, to the Gallery, January 25, 2024, copy in accession file\r\n",
