introduction: |
  The following examples describe different means by which a work changes hands. For objects in
  the Gallery's collection, the method of transfer to the Gallery should begin the final provenance
  record. Use the full name of the museum—Yale University Art Gallery—when indicating this
  transfer.

terms:
  - term: "The artist"
    description: |
      Begins a provenance citation to describe a transfer of ownership directly from
      the artist to the next owner. Do not include date of creation or life dates for artist (since
      these appear with tombstone). For commissions, see Commissioned by.
    examples:
      - |
        The artist, Easthampton, N.Y.; sold to Tiffany Sprague (1920–1999), Milford,
        Conn., 1950

  - term: "Commissioned by"
    description: |
      Begins a provenance citation to describe the original transfer of a
      work from the artist to a commissioning entity or to another owner on behalf of a
      commissioning entity. A commissioned work is defined as a work either ordered and
      subsequently paid for by the first owner or ordered and subsequently paid for by a donor
      on behalf of the first owner or custodian (see second example below). The first letter of
      Commissioned by should always be capitalized, as it will only be used at the head of a
      provenance citation (do not list The artist or the artist's name before Commissioned by, as
      his/her previous ownership is implied).
    examples:
      - |
        Commissioned by Jeanette Hancock Logan (1902–1980), Chicago, 1930
      - |
        Commissioned by Doge Antonio Grimani (1434–1523) for the church of Santa
        Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, 1499

  - term: "sale"
    description: |
      Describes sale of the work at auction or by a for-profit gallery. Include the following
      information, in this order: the word sale; auction house name (spell out ampersands and
      the abbreviation Co.; omit the abbreviations Ltd. or Inc.) and location (if the auction
      house is located in more than one city, use the city of sale); sale date(s) (use American
      style: month precedes day precedes year); and lot numbers (referenced as lot) or
      catalogue numbers (abbreviated as cat.). For eBay sales, also include seller username and
      item number, as in the third example below.
    notes: |
      If a sale took place over several days, list all days (examples: May 12–13, 1990;
      May 10 and 13, 1990; May 10–11 and 13, 1990). Omit title of sale (instead, be sure
      that the auction catalogue has been entered in the Bibliography Module of TMS).
      If a work included in an auction is unsold, place the provenance record in square
      brackets, followed by unsold in parentheses.
    examples:
      - |
        Sale, Hall du Savoy, Nice, France, June 24–28, 1942, lot 341
      - |
        [Sale, Sotheby's, London, May 5, 1944, lot 6 (unsold)]
      - |
        Sale, eBay (seller ID: tonefresh; item #555778990), December 3, 2020

  - term: "sold to"
    description: |
      Describes sale from one entity, private or institutional, to another. In general,
      avoid the phrase purchased by/from/in except in unusual circumstances, such as when
      there is no identifiable prior owner (for more information on such exceptions, see
      purchased by/acquired by). Never use bought by/from/through/in.
    notes: |
      For the sake of consistency, include full date (month, day, year) of auction sales
      with both the auction house and the subsequent owner (see third example below).
      Do not include prices; enter this information in the Provenance Remarks field
      (which does not push out to the Gallery's website) rather than the Provenance field. Use
      abbreviated monetary units before the numeral for the following: $, £, F, DM, fl. [for
      guilders], BF [for Belgian francs]. Spell out and place after the numeral: florins, livres, lire,
      scudi, ducados, pesos, etc.
    examples:
      - |
        Sold to Monsieur Cima (died 1963), Monte Carlo, Monaco, 1960

        1999), October 20, 1981; by inheritance to his niece, Chrissy Hines (born
        1975), 1999

  - term: "given to"
    description: |
      Describes transfer of ownership from a living owner to an individual (whether
      inside or outside the owner's family, as a gift [e.g., for a wedding] or for safekeeping,
      study, duplication, etc.) or to an institution (e.g., a museum). If a personal gift on a
      special occasion, include that information either in the provenance record or, if more
      complicated, as a note (for more on including notes, see Appendix 1).
    examples:
      - |
        Commissioned by Jeanette Hancock Logan (1902–1980), Chicago, 1930; given

        occasion of his appointment as curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston
        (Swarzenski et al. 1965).

  - term: "by inheritance to"
    description: |
      Describes transfer of ownership to an individual either inside or
      outside the family as established in a will (for transfer via a will to an institution, see
      bequeathed to). Also used when inheritance is otherwise established by law (e.g., through
      primogeniture, the English law that made the oldest son the heir to the family estate, even
      if there was no will or disposition of the estate).
    notes: |
      Include the nature of the relationship, if known, e.g., son, daughter, niece, etc. As
      appropriate, use or omit restrictive commas for husbands, wives, children, etc., per the
      rules in CMS17 6.28 (e.g., "by inheritance to her husband, Philip Matterhorn," "by
      inheritance to her daughter Jane Doe"); if uncertain (e.g., you cannot confirm if the
      owner had more than one daughter), do not include the comma.

      appropriate, use or omit restrictive commas for husbands, wives, children, etc., per the

      than one year and not as part of a temporary exhibition) to the Gallery or another
      institution. As transfer of ownership has not yet occurred, place the loan information in
      parentheses immediately following the owner. Include start and end dates of the loan,
      joining with an en-dash and eliding as necessary. If the loan is still active, use the
      formation "from + [start date]," as in the second example below; if the loan is also a
      promised gift, follow the third example below:
    examples:
      - |
        Rubin-Ladd Foundation, New York, 2004 (on loan to the San Antonio Museum
        of Art, 2004–12)

  - term: "purchased by/acquired by (from/through/in)"
    description: |

      that is, this phrase would only be used at the beginning of a provenance citation (see the last example below
      for an exception). Since there is no prior provenance record to indicate site of acquisition,
      place site of acquisition, if known, before the owner's name, as in the second example below.
    examples:
      - |
        Purchased by Arthur Moore (born 1955), Lagos, Nigeria, 1986
